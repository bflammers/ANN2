Description: Training of general classification and regression neural networks using 
    gradient descent. Special features include a function for training replicator 
    neural networks and a function for training autoencoders. Multiple activation and 
    cost functions (including Huber and pseudo-Huber) are supported, as well as L1 
    and L2 regularization, momentum, early stopping and the possibility to specify 
    a learning rate schedule. The package contains a vectorized gradient descent 
    implementation which facilitates faster training through batch learning.

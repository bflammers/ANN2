Description: Training of general classification and regression neural networks 
    using gradient descent. Special features include a function for training 
    autoencoders. Multiple activation and cost functions (including Huber and 
    pseudo-Huber) are supported, as well as L1 and L2 regularization, momentum, 
    early stopping and the possibility to specify a learning rate schedule. The 
    package contains a vectorized gradient descent implementation which facilitates 
    faster training through batch learning.

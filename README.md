# ANN2
Artificial Neural Networks package for R 


Training of general classification and regression neural networks using gradient descent. Special features include a function for training autoencoders as well as an implementation of replicator neural networks, for details see Hawkins et al. (2012). Multiple activation and cost functions (including Huber and pseudo-Huber) are included, as well as L1 and L2 regularization, momentum, early stopping and the possibility to specify a learning rate schedule. The package contains a vectorized gradient descent implementation which facilitates faster training through batch learning.
